      <p>
        Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web applications. 
        The scripts run in the userâ€™s browser, potentially stealing sensitive data, manipulating web content, or performing unwanted actions on behalf of the user.
        XSS are possible in VBScript, ActiveX, Flash and yes even in CSS - though they are most commonly used and associated with JavaScript.
