      <h2>What is XSS?</h2>
      <p>
        Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web applications. 
        The scripts run in the user’s browser, allowing attackers to steal sensitive data, manipulate web content, or perform actions without the user’s knowledge.
        XSS are possible in VBScript, ActiveX, Flash and yes even in CSS - though they are most commonly used and associated with JavaScript.

        <h2>How is XSS Possible?</h2>
        <p>
          XSS occurs when user input is not sanitized or escaped before being displayed on a webpage. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A website takes user input (for example a guestbook comment) and displays it directly on the page.</li>
          <li>If the input contains malicious scripts like <code>&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS');&lt;/script&gt;</code>, the website does not filter or escape it.</li>
          <li>When another user visits the page, their browser executes the malicious script instead of displaying it as plain text.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This happens when developers use methods like <code>innerHTML</code> to insert content into a webpage without proper filtering or escaping, 
          making the site vulnerable to XSS attacks.
        </p>

        <h2>Types of XSS</h2>
    
        <h3>1. Reflected XSS</h3>
        <p>
          The malicious payload is injected into a URL or HTTP request and is reflected back by the server in the response. 
          This often occurs in search results, error messages, or any page that dynamically displays user-provided input.
        </p>
        <div class="code-box">
          <code>
          http://example.com/search?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>When the server includes <code>q</code> in the response without sanitization, the script executes in the victim’s browser.</p>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Reflected XSS is not stored in the database - it’s simply reflected back on the current site to the user. It can occur in HTML attributes, directly within the HTML page or in the JavaScript context.</p>
  
        <ul>
            <li>Reflected XSS is <strong>temporary</strong> or <strong>non-persistent</strong> as the payload is not stored on the server.</li>
            <li>It requires a user to click on or interact with a specially created link or input. *See example above</li>
            <li>It affects only the specific user who interacts with the malicious input or URL.</li>
            <li>Attack vectors include query parameters, form inputs, or HTTP headers.</li>
        </ul>


    <h3>2. Stored XSS</h3>
    <p>
      The attacker’s payload is stored on the server (e.g., database, file system) and served to other users. 
      This is more dangerous because multiple victims viewing the injected/infected content are affected.
    </p>
    <div class="code-box">
      <code>
      Attacker posts a comment: <script>alert('XSS')</script><br>
      Every visitor will see the alert.
      </code>
